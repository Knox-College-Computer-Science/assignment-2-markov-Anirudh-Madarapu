This book is an attempt to explain communismâ€”what it is, how it works, what its aims are, and, most important of all, what we need to know to combat it.
The amount of material was voluminous: Party statements, resolutions, platforms, news accounts, manifestoes, the very first documents of American communism. 
I have deep faith in the American people and in our American way of life.
I owe deep thanks to many for help in the preparation of this book.
Never has there been a time when we have so much need for one another.
